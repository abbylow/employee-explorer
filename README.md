## Employee Directory Application
The envisioned directory application allows employees of a company to explore the company structure. A user of the application is able to see the names and team members of every supervisor.

## User Stories
| Story  | Acceptance Criteria  |
|---|---|
| As a user, I am able to search for employees  | - User is able to input the employee name in the input field - User is able to click search button  | 
| As a user, I want to know for a given employee who works directly for that given employee (direct reports) and who indirectly works for that given employee (all subordinates of structured tree)  | - The overview page should include information about direct and non-direct subordinates (all non-direct subordinates) - The overview shouldnâ€™t include duplicate employee names| 
| As a user, I am able to share or bookmark a link to the overview page of a given employee | Overview of given employee should be accessible through a direct URL. (http://app.com/overview?name={employeeName} or http://app.com/overview/{employeeName} ) | 

## Update
- replaced the class component to functional component (useHook for state management)
- use recursive component to display the subordinates (inspired by my friend, Hong Xiang)
